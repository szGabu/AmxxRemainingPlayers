## Description
  
The "Players Remaining" plugin provides real-time information about the number of remaining Counter-Terrorists (CTs) and Terrorists (Ts) in a game. The information is displayed to players via DHUD (HUD if DHUD is not possible) messages and is dynamically updated. The position and color is completely customizable.  
  
## Dependencies
